Here some programs I have made that may be useful for other researchers/students are kept. These are as error free as possible, but almost definitely aren't 100% perfect - let me know if you find errors! Everything is written in Python.




#### <b> Knife-edge beam profiler fitting </b>
<a href="../programs/knife_edge_fit.py" target="_blank"> This program </a> allows you to calculate the size of a laser beam simply by measuring the beam power on a power meter, and then scanning a razor blade (or other sharp object) through the face of the beam. Recording the transmitted power as a function of the razor blade position can then be fitted to a function that allows the beam radius (1/e^2) to be calculated. <a href="../pdfs/knife_edge_profiler.pdf" target="_blank"> A PDF </a> explaining how I derived the equation to fit to is here, for reference. The program is pretty self-explanatory and simple, but assumes that you are measuring the stage position in millimetres. It was intended initially for measuring on unfocussed beams, but could also be used with a focussed beam provided that you don't burn the knife edge. Commented out in the program is some example data I took from one of the laser systems in my lab.

#### <b> SFG Upconversion Simulator </b>
<a href="../programs/SFG_upconversion_simulator.py" target="_blank"> This program </a> is designed to allow you to generate the spectral line that a user-given molecular resonance will produce in an sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy measurement, with a given IR and visible pulse. Specifically, the aim is to allow the effect of the delay between IR and VIS, and the effect of the VIS (upconversion) pulse shape/width/length on the output spectrum to be seen. The program is pretty thoroughly commented and is quite straightforward to use, it will output an illustration of your input electric fields, and also the "ideal" spectral line (with perfect upconversion), together with the "actual" spectral line that your given upconverter will create. It does not account for realistic amplitudes and so cannot simulate an actual spectrum quantitatively, but illustrates the effects on spectral linewidth well. I would treat the results as semi-quantitative, as there are many factors aside from the VIS pulse that contribute to spectral linewidth. I think it is most useful as a teaching/pedagogical tool for people new to the field to mess around with.
