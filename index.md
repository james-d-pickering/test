Hello! My name is James and I'm a physical chemist. This site primarily exists as a repository for various research/teaching related materials that I've made over the years. You've probably found it as you're a student/ex-student of mine and I sent you the link when you asked me for some lecture notes (or something). 

Currently, I work at Aarhus University in Surflab with Tobias Weidner, using ultrafast lasers to study structure and dynamics of various things at various different kinds of surfaces. I've previously worked with Michael Burt at the University of Oxford (postdoc), Henrik Stapelfeldt at Aarhus University (PhD), and Mark Brouard at the University of Oxford (MChem). 

Besides research, I have a long standing interest and passion for scientific education, and I've previously held lectureships and teaching fellowships at the Universities of Oxford and Leicester respectively, teaching physical chemistry, physics, and mathematics to undergraduate chemistry students. Having done this for some years, I've accumulated quite a lot of teaching materials which mostly sit isolated in my Dropbox until someone asks for them. Hopefully hosting them here will mean they can be of more use to more people!
