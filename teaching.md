Over the years I have taught many courses in physical chemistry, physics, and mathematics to undergraduate students from chemistry (and related disciplines). For some of these courses I have made full lecture handouts/problem sets, whereas for others I just have PDF documents explaining tricky concepts (or things that my students found challenging). I have also made some similar documents for my research work, for new graduate students or final year undergraduates. The links below contain all of these that I've currently made. They are almost certainly not entirely error-free, so please let me know if you spot anything!

### Introductory Quantum Mechanics
This is the <a href="james-d-pickering.github.io/pdfs/introductory_quantum.pdf" target="_blank">handout </a>for a six lecture course designed for chemistry undergraduates meeting quantum mechanics for the first time. There is minimal assumed knowledge and it ends up providing a basic understanding of rotational and vibrational quantisation of simple molecules. It is kept quite qualitative, so there is minimal maths! There is also an associated <a href="james-d-pickering.github.io/pdfs/problems.pdf" target="_blank">problem set</a> with <a href="james-d-pickering.github.io/pdfs/solutions.pdf" target="_blank">solutions.</a>
