Over the years I have taught many courses in physical chemistry, physics, and mathematics to undergraduate students from chemistry (and related disciplines). For some of these courses I have made full lecture handouts/problem sets, whereas for others I just have PDF documents explaining tricky concepts (or things that my students found challenging). I have also made some similar documents for my research work, for new graduate students or final year undergraduates. The links below contain all of these that I've currently made. They are almost certainly not entirely error-free, so please let me know if you spot anything!



##### Full Handouts/Courses

#### Introductory Quantum Mechanics
This is the <a href="../pdfs/introductory_quantum.pdf" target="_blank">handout </a>for a six lecture course designed for chemistry undergraduates meeting quantum mechanics for the first time. There is minimal assumed knowledge and it ends up providing a basic understanding of rotational and vibrational quantisation of simple molecules. It is kept quite qualitative, so there is minimal maths! There is also an associated <a href="../pdfs/problems.pdf" target="_blank">problem set</a> with <a href="../pdfs/solutions.pdf" target="_blank">solutions.</a>

#### Data Analysis using Python 
This is the <a href="../pdfs/data_analysis_using_python_v3.pdf" target="_blank">handout </a> for a short course aimed to help undergraduate chemistry students with no knowledge of programming to be able make simple plots and figures using Python (it's probably badly named as it doesn't really help you do any actual analysis in retrospect..). It will maybe be useful for anyone who wants to start using Python to generate figures (as everyone should). 

#### Simulating a Velocity-Map Imaging Spectrometer
This rather rambling <a href="../pdfs/vmi_simulation.pdf" target="_blank">document </a> was the culmination of one of the worst things I've ever been asked to do in my life. I was mostly trying to find a good geometry for a velocity-map imaging spectrometer, but then ended up in a SIMION rabbit hole and it was all a fairly dark and depressing experience. Hopefully this document a) explains a bit about how VMI works; b) demonstrates that the geometry that Eppink and Parker made in the 80s is still basically fine for 99% of users; and c) helps people use SIMION (which is excellent software, looking back) and Lua without wanting to rend down their computer in a vat of acid after every work day. It's really aimed at new graduate students.

##### Short Explanatory Notes

#### Nuclear Spin Statistics
The influence of nuclear spin statistics on rotational spectra often seems confusing, and it can seem that there are a lot of formulae pulled out of the ether to help explain what we see. This <a href="../pdfs/spin_statistics.pdf" target="_blank">short note</a> aims to explain the influence of nuclear spin statistics by considering the effect of a rotation on the total wavefunction of a diatomic molecule. It assumes you're reasonably adept with typical undergraduate chemist level quantum mechanics!

#### Combination Differences
This <a href="../pdfs/combination_differences.pdf" target="_blank">note </a> walks through the process of taking combination differences of lines in a rovibrational spectrum (a high resolution IR spectrum so that rotational lines are resolved as well as vibrational lines). By doing this you can find rotational constants for the different vibrational levels, and extrapolate back to an "equilibrium" rotational constant (if such a thing is meaningful!). 

#### Matrix Multiplication
In my experience people tend to be fine with matrix multiplication when it's done on a literal matrix, but then fall apart when you write the matrix multiplication using summation notation (which is obviously a lot more powerful if you want to multiply a big matrix). This <a href="../pdfs/matrix_multiplication.pdf" target="_blank">note </a> explains how you do this, and what steps are legal/illegal when using the sum notation. 

#### Ultrafast Photochemistry
I made this <a href="../pdfs/Photochem_supplement.pdf" target="_blank">beautifully handwritten </a> document as a supplement to the slides of an photochemistry course I was teaching. I felt like some of the detail about ultrafast photochemistry was a bit missing, so made this as a supplement. 

#### Degeneracy in Molecular Term Symbols
This <a href="../pdfs/Moleculartermsymboldegeneracy.pdf" target="_blank">whiteboard </a> was made after a lockdown online tutorial in which one of my excellent students at Merton college pointed out that I'd been teaching this incorrectly for a whole year. It aims to explain why the degeneracy of a molecular term is not the standard 2J+1 (in atoms), but is actually 2S+1. It boils down to how the angular momentum vectors are projected, and in molecules you project to the molecule-fixed axis not the space-fixed axis.
