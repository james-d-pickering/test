Over the years I have taught many courses in physical chemistry, physics, and mathematics to undergraduate students from chemistry (and related disciplines). For some of these courses I have made full lecture handouts/problem sets, whereas for others I just have PDF documents explaining tricky concepts (or things that my students found challenging). I have also made some similar documents for my research work, for new graduate students or final year undergraduates. The links below contain all of these that I've currently made. They are almost certainly not entirely error-free, so please let me know if you spot anything!
