My research broadly falls under the umbrella of "ultrafast spectroscopy and dynamics", where ultrashort (femtosecond) laser pulses are use to probe chemical structure and dynamics on their natural timescales. Developments in femtosecond laser technology over the last two decades mean that 'turn-key' femtosecond laser systems are now widely available. This means that the ability to generate and use ultrashort pulses to study atomic and molecular processes is no longer solely the preserve of specialist laser physicists, and scientists from a wide range of backgrounds are now able to set these systems up and use them to study all kinds of chemical and biological problems. I would probably consider myself to be a "laser enthusiast", so am always interested in big/powerful/broadband/interesting laser systems. 

For most of my research so far I have focussed on gas-phase (or quasi-condensed-phase) structure and dynamics. This was the focus of my MChem, PhD, and first postdoc. However, most recently I have switched direction slightly and now am much more on the "spectroscopy" end of "spectroscopy and dynamics", working on sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy and sum-frequency scattering in Surflab with Tobias Weidner. My PhD thesis is <a href="../pdfs/thesis_jdp_finalprint.pdf" target="_blank"> linked here </a>, if of interest.
